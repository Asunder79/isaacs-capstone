// WILL be built tomorrow, no changes made yet.
//Will pull from a JSON and render the text from that JSON entry seqeuntially every few seconds.
// Potentially add fade in/fade out effects for smoother transitions between facts.
//it is under public/server/utils/facts.json, thats where you'll find the facts to be rendered.
// Will use fetch to get the JSON data and then manipulate the DOM to show the facts one by one.

// Placeholder for future implementation
