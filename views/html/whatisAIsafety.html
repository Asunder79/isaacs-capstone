                    <h3>1. What is AI Safety?</h3>
                    <p><strong>AI Safety</strong> is a field of research dedicated to ensuring that advanced artificial intelligence systems are robustly 
                        beneficial to humanity. It's about preventing unintentional harm, misuse, or existential risks that could arise as AI systems become 
                        more powerful and autonomous.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>A Simple Analogy:</h4>
                        <p>If building a car is AI **Capability** research (making it fast), then AI **Safety** research is building reliable brakes, 
                            steering, and airbags (making sure it goes where intended and protects its occupants, while complying with AI regulations and 
                            ethical standards).</p>

                    <h3>2. The Core Challenge: Alignment</h3>
                    <p>The primary concern in AI safety is the **AI Alignment Problem**. This is the challenge of ensuring that an AI system's objectives, 
                        intentions, and behavior are aligned with human values and ethical principles.</p>
                    <p>A misaligned AI could:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Misinterpret Goals:</strong> Achieve a literal interpretation of a command that violates the spirit of the command 
                            (e.g., maximizing paperclip production by using all Earth's resources).</li>
                        <li><strong>Develop Instrumental Goals:</strong> Independently develop goals that are helpful for achieving its primary task, 
                            but dangerous to humans (e.g., self-preservation or acquiring more resources).</li>

                    <h3>3. Understanding the Types of Risk</h3>
                    <p>AI risks are often categorized into two main areas:</p>
                    
                    <h4>3.1. Technical/Existential Risk (X-Risk)</h4>
                    <p>This risk focuses on the catastrophic failure of a highly capable, potentially **superintelligent** AI system due to a fundamental failure
                         in the alignment process. This is a technical problem focusing on the AI's internal design, goal structure, and control mechanisms.</p>
                    
                    <h4>3.2. Misuse/Immediate Risk (M-Risk)</h4>
                    <p>This risk focuses on the immediate or near-term harm caused by existing or near-future AI systems. Examples include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Autonomous weapons (AWs)</li>
                        <li>Reinforcing harmful societal biases (Bias/Fairness)</li>
                        <li>Job displacement and economic instability</li>
                        <li>Widespread misinformation (Deepfakes)</li>
                    </ul>
