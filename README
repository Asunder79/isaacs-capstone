## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great knowledge hubs available on the internet; however, I didn't find one focused on AI that truthfully felt like
users can contribute to a shared pool of knowledge and information.
Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on curating a shared information pool. A pool which you can contribute to
- You shouldn't let being uninformed create fear of an industry shifting tool. Use our pool of knowledge to better inform yourself.
- Forewarned is forearmed. You can make better informed advocacy decisions using our tool than before.

Of course, for the time being this is rudimentary. I look to expand my app after this program to maybe introduce a discussion system, and a user/profile system (as it stands, its an anonymous knowledge hub where anyone can contribute)
